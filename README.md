# Mouse Translation Tool

Mouse Translation Tool is a lightweight application designed to translate clipboard text on-the-fly. 
It uses the Google Translate API to perform translations and displays the translated text near your mouse pointer. 
This app is particularly useful for those who frequently need to translate snippets of text while browsing or working with documents.

## Features
- **Automatic Translation:** Copies text to your clipboard and itâ€™s automatically translated.
- **Language Choice:** Select your desired target language from a list.
- **Real-time Notifications:** The translation appears near your mouse cursor.
- **Background Operation:** Runs silently in the background with a tray icon for easy access.
